CNB cognitive tasks.

Setup:
Install perl5 via homebrew
Install mysql server 8 from myssql website.
Copy SQL dump from production server.
Load SQL dump into your local database.
Checkout CNB code.
Place code in /Library/WebServer/Documents/webcnp
Create necessary folders.
The following step is only necessary currently.

Adding a new test:
Create a test document.
Create a test trials JSON file.
Add a test version for the test if it needs a new one.

Upload test document and trials file.

Create task in tasks folder.
Create task trials handler in trials folder.
Create any new test instructions handlers in the instructions folder.
Create any new test components in components folder.
Add test specific styles in styles folder.
Add test specific assets (ie banner) to the assets/test/ folder.
If test requires specific rendering (ie via canvas) add stimuli definition in stimuli folder.
Finally add task to tools/TestRunner.js for rendering.
Update tests table for tests that inherit rendering from this test as follows:
update tests set parent_test = <test_version_id> where tests like '%test_regex%';
For example with motor praxis:
update tests set parent_test = 1 where tests like '%mpraxis-2.05%';
NB: Once set, all those tests that have the parent test will run the test you developed regardless of whether they are in Adobe Flash or react.
Test task locally by setting test param in main/TaskHandler.js
npm start
Go to /assess to view test
