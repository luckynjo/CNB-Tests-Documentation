This is a test to see how well you can control your attention.
In this test, you will see different kinds of words or strings of X's printed in different colors (red, blue, and green). Always identify the COLOR OF WHAT YOU SEE and ignore what the word says. We want you to identify each color as fast as you can.

The "V" key stands for the color RED.
The "B" key stands for the color BLUE.
