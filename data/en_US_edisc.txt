That is not correct. Please try again.

Page 5: Instructions
Two amounts of money will be shown on the screen. You will be asked whether you would rather receive the smaller amount by doing less work, or the bigger amount by doing more work.
In this task, the work you will be asked to think about is answering questions on the Bigger Number Task you just finished. For example, when an options says “250 presses” that means answering 250 of the Bigger Number Task questions.

Page 6: Instructions
This is a “pretending” exercise – you will not really receive any money and you will not really do the work. But we ask you to make your choices as if they were real. There are no correct or incorrect answers.
Make your choice by clicking on one of the blue buttons. Remember, when we are talking about presses, we are referring to answering that number of questions of the Bigger Number Test.

Page 7: Instructions
You will get to practice before you begin, so don’t worry if you don't understand everything yet. You can ask as many questions as you like during the practice. Once the actual task begins, we cannot answer any more questions.
