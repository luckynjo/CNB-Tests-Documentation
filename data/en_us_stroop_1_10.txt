Instructions:
This is a test to see how well you can control your attention.
In this test, you will see different kinds of words or strings of X's printed in different colors (red, blue, and green). Always identify the COLOR OF WHAT YOU SEE and ignore what the word says. We want you to identify each color as fast as you can.

Page 3: Demo Hand Instructions
You will use the "V", "B", and "N" keys on the bottom row of the keyboard to make a response. Rest your first three fingers (index, middle, and ring fingers) of your hand on the keys, covering the letters but not pressing any key until you want to make a response.
The "V" key stands for the color RED.
The "B" key stands for the color BLUE.
The "N" key stands for the color GREEN.
Are you using your right or left hand to do this test? Click on one of the buttons below to continue.
