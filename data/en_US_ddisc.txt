Instructions:
The purpose of this task is to measure your preferences for different hypothetical amounts of money. Please make your decisions as if all choices involved were real. We are interested in which reward you would choose to receive if you were offered these choices for real. There are no correct or incorrect choices.
Two amounts of money will appear on the screen. One amount can be received right now. The other amount can be received later. The screen will show you how long you will have to wait to receive that amount. The amount of the "right now" reward will change after each of your decisions. The "later" reward will stay the same for a group of choices.

Indicate the option you would prefer by clicking on one of the blue buttons.
You will get to practice before you begin, so don't worry if you might not understand everything yet. Many people say the task makes more sense once they begin. During practice, ask as many questions as you like. Once the actual task begins, we cannot answer any further questions, so please be sure you understand the decision-making task before the end of the practice choices.
